# React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

This repository contains the code for the official React tutorial: **Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Game**. The tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of React and guide you step-by-step in creating a simple yet interactive game.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn the following key concepts:

- **Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable pieces.
- **Props and State**: Managing and passing data between components.
- **Immutability**: Why it's important and how it helps with complex features like "time travel".
- **Handling Events**: React's way of capturing and responding to user input.

By the end of the tutorial, you will have built a fully functioning Tic-Tac-Toe game with the ability to:

- Place X's and O's.
- Alternate turns between two players.
- Declare a winner or a draw.
- Display the game's move history and allow "time travel" to previous moves.
